# Customer-Segmentation-using-KNN
Machine learning, Python

Our objective is to build a classifier, to predict the class of unknown cases. We will use a specific type of classification called K nearest neighbor. 
A telecommunications provider has segmented its customer base by service usage patterns, categorizing the customers into four groups.


The target field, called __custcat__, has four possible values that correspond to the four customer groups, as follows:

  1- Basic Service

  2- E-Service

  3- Plus Service

  4- Total Service
