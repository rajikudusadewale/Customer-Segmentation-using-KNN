# Customer-Segmentation-using-KNN
Machine learning, Python



### Introduction
- **Title:** K Nearest Neighbor
- **Objective:** To build a KNN classifier to predict the classification of unknown cases within the customer base of a telecommunications provider.

### Data Description
- **Segmentation:** The customer base is segmented into four groups based on service usage patterns.
- **Target Variable:** The `custcat` field, which includes four values corresponding to the customer groups:
  - Basic Service
  - E-Service
  - Plus Service
  - Total Service

### Methodology
1. **Data Preparation:**
   - Import relevant libraries for data manipulation (pandas, numpy) and visualization (matplotlib).
   - Load the customer data from a CSV file into a pandas DataFrame.
   - Perform initial data exploration to understand the dataset's structure.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis:**
   - The notebook likely contains statistical summaries and visualizations to explore the customer data and understand the distribution across different segments.

3. **Model Development:**
   - Implement the KNN algorithm to create a predictive model.
   - Configure the model to identify the nearest neighbors and classify the customers accordingly.
